# DebtX

## Project Overview

DebtX is a full-stack debt collection and management application designed to streamline tracking and managing customer debts. It features a Next.js frontend for a responsive UI, a Node.js/Express backend with real-time notifications via Socket.IO, and a PostgreSQL database (hosted on Supabase) managed with Prisma ORM. Key functionalities include uploading customer data (via Excel/CSV or single entry), viewing dynamic dashboards, managing payment statuses, and receiving real-time activity updates.

## Setup Instructions

### Local Setup

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/singhjatin297/DebtX.git
   cd DebtX
   ```
2. cd backend
   npm install

3. cd ..
   npm install

4. setup .env file based on .env.example for both frontend

5. cd backend
   npm run dev

6. cd ..
   npm run dev

7. start both frontend and backend with npm run dev

Technical Decisions

    Next.js: Selected for its fast frontend development, built-in routing, and client-side rendering capabilities, enhancing user experience with a
    responsive dashboard.

    Node.js/Express: Provides a lightweight, flexible backend with RESTful APIs and integrates seamlessly with Socket.IO for real-time features.

    Prisma: Simplifies database interactions with type-safe queries and migrations, ideal for managing PostgreSQL data.

    Socket.IO: Enables real-time updates for notifications (e.g., payment status changes, new customers), improving user engagement.

    PostgreSQL (Supabase): Chosen as a hosted SQL database for structured data management, meeting the "SQL/Elasticsearch" requirement (Elasticsearch considered for future search).

    JWT with Cookies: Adopted for stateless, secure authentication (using token cookie), aligning with the specâ€™s "JWT authentication" requirement over session-based cookies.

    Docker: Included for consistent environments, though currently being debugged for full functionality.

Future Improvements

    Docker Fix: Resolve .env loading issues in docker-compose.yml for seamless containerized deployment.

    Pagination: Implement for customers and notifications to handle large datasets efficiently.

    Enhanced Authentication: Explore OAuth or additional JWT features (e.g., refresh tokens) for broader security options.

    Testing: Add unit and integration tests for API endpoints, Socket.IO events, and frontend components.

    UI Enhancements: Incorporate more Framer Motion animations for a polished, interactive experience.

    Search Functionality: Integrate Elasticsearch for advanced search capabilities if required by future needs.
